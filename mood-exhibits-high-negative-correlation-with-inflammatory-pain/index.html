description: "N=1 study showing higher overall mood predicts lower inflammatory pain (R=-0.343, p=0.001). Inflammatory pain was 13% higher after low mood (3.54/5) vs 9% lower after high mood (4.14/5)."

			<h3>Study Abstract</h3>
<p class="ng-binding">These data suggest with a high degree of confidence (p=0.001) that Overall Mood (Emotions) has a weakly positive predictive relationship (R=-0.343) with Inflammatory Pain (Symptoms). The highest quartile of Inflammatory Pain measurements were observed following an average 3.54/5Overall Mood. The lowest quartile of Inflammatory Pain measurements were observed following an average 4.14/5Overall Mood.</p>
<h3>Study Background</h3>
<p class="ng-binding">In order to reduce suffering through the advancement of human knowledge, I have chosen to share my findings regarding the relationship between Overall Mood and Inflammatory Pain.</p>

<p class="ng-binding">The objective of this study is to determine the nature of the relationship (if any) between the Overall Mood and the Inflammatory Pain. Additionally, we attempt to determine the Overall Mood values most likely to produce optimal Inflammatory Pain values.</p>
<h3>Study Design</h3>
<p class="ng-binding">This study design is consistent with an n=1 observational natural experiment.</p>
<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
<p class="ng-binding">It was assumed that 0 hours would pass before a change in Overall Mood would produce an observable change in Inflammatory Pain. It was assumed that Overall Mood could produce an observable change in Inflammatory Pain for as much as 1 days after the stimulus event.</p>
<h3>Data Sources</h3>
<p class="ng-binding">The <a href="/">QuantiModo</a> platform was used to aggregate data from the <a href="/data-sources">data sources</a>.</p>
<p>Overall Mood data was collect using: <a href="/data-sources">Good Day Journal, MoodiModo, MoodiModo Ionic, MoodiModo Web, MoodPanda, Moodscope, QuAnTiMo.Do, QuantiModo, QuantiPress</a>.</p>
<p>Inflammatory Pain data was collected using: <a href="/data-sources">Cardiograph</a>.</p>
<h3>Significance Explanation</h3>
<p class="ng-binding">Using a two-tailed t-test with alpha = 0.05, it was determined that the change in Inflammatory Pain is statistically significant at 95% confidence interval.</p>
<h3>Study Limitations</h3>
<p class="ng-binding">As with any human experiment, it was impossible to control for all potentially confounding variables. The confidence in a causal relationship is bolstered by the fact that time-precedence was taken into account in all calculations. Furthermore, in accordance with the law of large numbers (LLN), the predictive power and accuracy of these results will continually grow over time. 51 paired data points were used in this analysis. Assuming that the relationship is merely coincidental, as the participant independently modifies their Overall Mood values, the observed strength of the relationship will decline until it is below the threshold of significance. Furthermore, it will be very enlightening to aggregate this data with the data from other participants with similar genetic, diseasomic, environmentomic, and demographic profiles.</p>
<h3>Study Results</h3>
<p class="ng-binding">This analysis suggests that HIGHER Overall Mood (Emotions) generally predicts LOWER Inflammatory Pain (p = 0.001). Inflammatory Pain is, on average, 13% HIGHER after around 3.54 Overall Mood. After an onset delay of 24 hours, Inflammatory Pain is, on average, -9% LOWER than its average over the 24 hours following around 4.14 Overall Mood. 51 data points were used in this analysis. The value for Overall Mood changed 474 times, effectively running 237 separate natural experiments. The top quartile outcome values are preceded by an average 3.54 /5 of Overall Mood. The bottom quartile outcome values are preceded by an average 4.14 /5 of Overall Mood. Forward Pearson Correlation Coefficient was -0.343 (p=0.001, 95% CI -0.572 to -0.113 onset delay = 0 hours, duration of action = 24 hours) . The Reverse Pearson Correlation Coefficient was -0.398 (P=0.001, 95% CI -0.628 to -0.168, onset delay = -0 hours, duration of action = -24 hours). When the Overall Mood value is closer to 3.54 /5 than 4.14 /5, the Inflammatory Pain value which follows is, on average, 13% percent higher than its typical value. When the Overall Mood value is closer to 4.14 /5 than 3.54 /5, the Inflammatory Pain value which follows is 0% lower than its typical value.</p>
