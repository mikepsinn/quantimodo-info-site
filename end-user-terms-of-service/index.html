<p><b><i>Last Updated: December 2024</i></b></p>

<h3><b>About These Terms</b></h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Mike P. Sinn, and I maintain the QuantiModo open source health data research framework. By using any of the tools, APIs, or services I provide ("Services"), you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the Services.</p>

<p>I may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the Services after updates means you accept the new terms. You can always find the current version here.</p>

<h3><b>What the QuantiModo Framework Does</b></h3>
<p>The QuantiModo framework helps collect, analyze, and visualize health and life-tracking data. When you use the Services, you're authorizing me to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access specific types of your data (like personal tracker data or health records)</li>
<li>Store, process, and analyze this data</li>
<li>Display your data back to you in useful formats</li>
<li>Share aggregate, de-identified data for research purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>The technical solutions (APIs and SDKs) are described in detail on <a href="https://QuAnTiMo.Do">https://QuAnTiMo.Do</a> and {% include "github-link.njk" %}.</p>

<h3><b>Your Data and Privacy</b></h3>
<p>You own your data. By using the Services, you authorize me to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store a secure copy of your health data for analysis and research</li>
<li>Use aggregate, de-identified data for research and improving the Services</li>
<li>Release de-identified data to researchers under proper IRB approval</li>
</ul>

<p>I will NOT:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell your personal data</li>
<li>Share your identifiable data without your explicit permission</li>
<li>Contact you with third-party advertising without your permission</li>
</ul>

<p>You can opt out of marketing communications anytime by emailing {% include "contact-email.njk" %}.</p>

<h3><b>Your Responsibilities</b></h3>
<p>When using the Services, you agree to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide accurate information</li>
<li>Not use the Services for anything illegal, harmful, or abusive</li>
<li>Not try to reverse engineer, hack, or compromise the Services</li>
<li>Not harm minors in any way</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Open Source and Intellectual Property</b></h3>
<p>The QuantiModo framework is open source. The code is available on {% include "github-link.njk" %} under the specified licenses. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>I retain intellectual property rights to the Services and framework as a whole</li>
<li>You can't use QuantiModo trademarks without permission</li>
<li>Any improvements or contributions you make may be incorporated into the project</li>
</ul>

<p>The basic Services are free for end users. If you're interested in custom development, consulting, or enterprise support, contact me at {% include "contact-email.njk" %}.</p>

<h3><b>Termination</b></h3>
<p>You can stop using the Services anytime. I may also suspend or terminate access if you violate these terms or for other operational reasons. I reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Services at any time.</p>

<h3><b>DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b></h3>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ:</strong></p>

<p>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES. I'M ONE PERSON MAINTAINING AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT, SO I MAKE NO GUARANTEES ABOUT:</p>

<li>Fitness for any particular purpose</li>
<li>Security or data integrity (though I do my best)</li>
<li>Medical accuracy or suitability for medical decisions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MEDICAL DISCLAIMER:</strong> The Services are for research and informational purposes only. They are NOT medical devices and should NOT be used for medical diagnosis or treatment. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical advice.</p>

<p><strong>LIABILITY LIMIT:</strong> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data loss or corruption</li>

<li>Any decisions you make based on the Services</li>
<li>Any indirect, consequential, or special damages</li>
</ul>

<p>Some jurisdictions don't allow these limitations, so they may not apply to you.</p>

<h3><b>Indemnification</b></h3>
<p>You agree to hold me harmless from any claims arising from your use of the Services or violation of these terms.</p>

<h3><b>Dispute Resolution</b></h3>
<p>If we have a dispute, let's try to work it out directly first by emailing {% include "contact-email.njk" %}. If that doesn't work, these terms are governed by Missouri law, and any legal proceedings should be filed within one year of the issue arising.</p>

<h3><b>Miscellaneous</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>These terms don't create any partnership or employment relationship</li>
<li>If any part of these terms is found invalid, the rest still applies</li>
<li>Your data may be transmitted across various networks and adapted to technical requirements</li>
<li>I may need to disclose your data if required by law</li>
</ul>
