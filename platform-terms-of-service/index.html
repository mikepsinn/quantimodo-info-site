<p><b><i>Last Updated: December 2024</i></b></p>

<h3><b>About These Terms</b></h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Mike P. Sinn, a freelance developer maintaining the QuantiModo open source health data research framework. These terms cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the QuantiModo Framework in your applications</li>
<li>Accessing the APIs and SDKs</li>
<li>Custom development and consulting services</li>
<li>Integration support</li>
</ul>

<p>By using the Framework or engaging me for services ("Services"), you agree to these terms.</p>

<h3><b>Open Source Framework</b></h3>
<p>The QuantiModo Framework is open source and available on {% include "github-link.njk" %}. The framework provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>APIs for health data collection and analysis</li>
<li>SDKs for various platforms</li>
<li>Data integration connectors</li>
<li>Analytics and visualization tools</li>
</ul>

<p>The code is provided under the open source licenses specified in each repository. However, I retain overall intellectual property rights to the framework as a whole.</p>

<h3><b>License to Use the Framework</b></h3>
<p>I grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Framework for your applications, subject to these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the applicable open source license terms</li>
<li>Don't remove attribution or copyright notices</li>
<li>Don't use "QuantiModo" trademarks without permission</li>
<li>Don't try to reverse engineer proprietary components</li>
<li>Don't use the Framework for illegal or harmful purposes</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Custom Development & Consulting Services</b></h3>
<p>I'm available for hire for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom health data application development</li>
<li>Framework integration and customization</li>
<li>HIPAA-compliant application development</li>
<li>Data analysis and research consulting</li>
<li>API development and integration</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To discuss your project:</strong> Email me at {% include "contact-email.njk" %} with details about what you need. I'll provide a proposal with scope, timeline, and pricing.</p>

<h3><b>Payment Terms</b></h3>
<p>For custom development work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rates and payment schedules will be specified in our project agreement</li>
<li>Typically invoiced on milestone completion or monthly basis</li>
<li>Payment due within 30 days of invoice</li>
<li>Late payments may result in project suspension</li>
</ul>

<p>The basic framework itself is free and open source. Fees only apply to custom development, consulting, or premium support services.</p>

<h3><b>Your Data and User Data</b></h3>
<p>When you integrate the Framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You own your data</strong> - Any data you collect through your implementation belongs to you</li>
<li><strong>User data</strong> - You're responsible for your users' data and must comply with privacy laws (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Aggregate data</strong> - I may use aggregate, anonymized usage statistics to improve the Framework</li>
<li><strong>No access without permission</strong> - I won't access your users' data without explicit authorization</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Support and Maintenance</b></h3>
<p>For the open source framework:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community support</strong> - Available through GitHub issues and discussions</li>
<li><strong>Bug fixes</strong> - I maintain and update the framework when time permits</li>
<li><strong>No SLA</strong> - This is an open source project, so there's no guaranteed response time</li>
</ul>

<p>For custom development clients:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project support</strong> - Included during project development</li>
<li><strong>Post-launch support</strong> - Available on a retainer or hourly basis</li>
<li><strong>Priority support</strong> - Contact me to discuss ongoing support arrangements</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Intellectual Property</b></h3>
<p><strong>Open Source Framework:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The framework code is licensed under the terms in each repository</li>

</ul>

<p>I may suspend or terminate access if you violate these terms.</p>

<h3><b>WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS</b></h3>

<p><strong>Maximum liability:</strong> For any claim, my total liability is limited to the amount you paid me in the three months before the claim (or $100 if you haven't paid anything).</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions don't allow these limitations, so they may not apply to you.</p>

<p>You agree to indemnify and hold me harmless from claims arising from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your use of the Framework</li>

</ul>

</ol>

<h3><b>Miscellaneous</b></h3>

<li>If any provision is invalid, the rest still applies</li>
<li>Missouri law governs these terms</li>
<li>This is the complete agreement between us</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Updates and Changes</b></h3>
<p>I may update these terms from time to time. For existing custom development projects, the terms we agreed to at project start will continue to apply. For framework usage, continued use after updates means you accept the new terms.</p>
